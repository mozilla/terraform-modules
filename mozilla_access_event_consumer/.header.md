# Mozilla Access Event Consumer Module

This Terraform module creates the infrastructure needed for a tenant application to consume access event notifications from a centrally-managed Pub/Sub topic. It supports both Cloud Functions and GKE.

## Deployment Modes

1. **Cloud Function Mode** automatically triggered by Pub/Sub events
- Prefer **Cloud Functions** if you don't have GKE resources or in cases where your exit flows don't have any dependencies on your tenant's GKE resources
2. **GKE Mode**  Pull messages from your tenant GKE setup
- Use **GKE** if you prefer to manage your exit logic along with the rest of your application and GKE deployment

## Usage

### Cloud Function Mode

Deploy a Cloud Function that uses [Eventarc](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/tutorials/pubsub-eventdriven) to handle Pub/Sub events:

```hcl
module "exit_consumer" {
  # see https://github.com/mozilla/terraform-modules?tab=readme-ov-file#using-these-modules for versioning strategies
  source = "github.com/mozilla/terraform-modules//mozilla_access_event_consumer?ref=main"

  project_id          = local.project_id
  application         = local.application
  environment         = local.environment
  function_source_dir = "${path.module}/exit-processor"
}
```

### GKE Mode

Create a Pub/Sub subscription for pull-based processing from GKE:

```hcl
module "exit_consumer" {
  # see https://github.com/mozilla/terraform-modules?tab=readme-ov-file#using-these-modules for versioning strategies
  source = "github.com/mozilla/terraform-modules//mozilla_access_event_consumer?ref=main"

  project_id  = local.project_id
  application = local.application
  environment = local.environment

  # Provide GKE service account for GKE mode
  service_account = module.tenant.gke_service_account_email
}
```

## Message Format

Access event messages have this structure:

```json
{
  "event_type": "employee_exit",
  "event_time": "2026-01-26T00:00:00Z",
  "employee_email": "user@mozilla.com",
  "employee_name": "Jane Doe",
  "publish_time": "2026-01-28T19:02:25.123456Z",
  "event_data": {
    "manager_name": "Jane Manager",
    "manager_email": "manager@mozilla.com"
  }
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `event_type` (string, required): Type of access event. Currently supports `"employee_exit"`.
- `event_time` (string, nullable): ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred.
- `employee_email` (string, nullable): Email address of the employee.
- `employee_name` (string, nullable): Full name of the employee.
- `publish_time` (string, required): ISO 8601 timestamp of when the message was published.
- `event_data` (object, nullable): Event-specific data. For `employee_exit` events, contains:
  - `manager_name` (string): Name of the employee's manager.
  - `manager_email` (string): Email address of the employee's manager.

## IAM Role Management

The module creates a service account (in Cloud Function mode) or uses your GKE service account (in GKE mode) and grants minimal permissions:

**Cloud Function mode (Eventarc):**
- `roles/run.invoker` - Allows Pub/Sub service agent to invoke the function
- Eventarc automatically manages subscription and permissions

**GKE mode (manual subscription):**
- `roles/pubsub.subscriber` - To pull messages from the subscription
- `roles/pubsub.viewer` - To view subscription metadata

**Additional IAM roles you must manage:**
- `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` - Required for each GSM resource referenced in `function_gsm_environment_variables`
- Database access roles (e.g., Cloud SQL, Firestore)
- Any other application-specific permissions

Use the `service_account_email` output to grant these permissions in your own Terraform code.

## Examples

- **[examples/gke/](./examples/gke/)** - GKE with batch processing
