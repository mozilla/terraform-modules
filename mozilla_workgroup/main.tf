/**
 * # workgroup
 * Retrieve workgroup ACL lists associated with data and gcp access workgroups.
 *
 * Workgroup identifiers should be of the form:
 *
 * ```
 * workgroup:WORKGROUP_NAME[/SUBGROUP]
 * ```
 *
 * where `SUBGROUP` defaults to `default`. For example: `workgroup:app`, `workgroup:app/admin`.
 *
 * For subgroup queries across all workgroups, an additional identifier format:
 *
 * ```
 * subgroup:SUBGROUP
 * ```
 *
 * is supported, which will return all workgroups that contain a particular subgroup.
 *
 * This module is cloned from https://github.com/mozilla-services/cloudops-infra-terraform-modules/tree/master/data-workgroup.
 *
