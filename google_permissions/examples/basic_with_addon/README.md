# Basic With Additional Resources Example

This example shows how to grant the core set of permissions as specified [here](../../main.tf) but then add additional resources to the project. 

The current list of available additional resources can be found [here](../../other_perms.tf)

Also, you provide a list of additional permissions beyond the core set that you want to grant as the `other_permissions` variable.
