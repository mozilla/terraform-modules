# Admin-only Example

This example shows how you would grant permissions to a tenant project where you *ONLY* want admin access and don't need the granularity of the other options.

The permissions granted can be found [here](../../admin_only.tf).

`admin_only` toggles on the admin-only permission set.

`admin_members` is the admin workgroup already created.
