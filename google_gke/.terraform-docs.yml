  ## Simple Example

  This uses distinct networking variables and the (module) default node pool.

  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/simple.tf" }}
  ```

  ## Complex Example 1

   This uses a Mozilla-internal Shared VPC Terraform outputs variable for networking. It also sets up cluster to be able to access GAR images in a different project.

  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/complex1.tf" }}
  ```

  ## Complex Example 2

   This uses a Mozilla-internal Shared VPC Terraform outputs variable for networking. It creates multiple node pools with some defaults changed per node pool.

  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/complex2.tf" }}
  ```
